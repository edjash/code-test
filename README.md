4. Familiarity with version control? Git?
5. Familiarity with unit testing?
6. Open source projects participation?
7. What does your work environment look like? What tools do you use for development/debugging?
8. Linux user/server administration experience? SSH?
9. Rate how comfortable/experienced you are in the following areas
    - HTML
    - Sass/CSS
    - Javascript/JQuery
    - React/Vue/Angular/Backbone/etc (other JS frameworks)
    - PHP
    - Python
    - MySQL/MariaDB/Postgres
    - Redis/Memcached
    - Other backend languages (Ruby/Java/etc)
10. Solve the following program using a language of your choice, we have included files for PHP and Python, these include
helpers for parsing json. 

We are looking for a class/function that combines the data from the two included JSON files (`vehicle_groups.json` and
`vehicles.json`) and outputs the data in the following format (we expect a JSON response):

```
{
    "vehicles": [array],
    "vehicle_stats": [object]
}
 ```
 
In the `vehicles` array, we expect the vehicle id to be the key, and the object to be the value, with the following keys 
in the object:

```
[
vehicle_id: {
    "lat": [float],
    "lng": [float],
    "speed": [float],
    "groups": [array of integers],
    "status": [string]
    },...
]
```

An example of this would be:

```
{
    "vehicles": [
        7: {
            "lat": 55.555,
            "lng": 22.222,
            "speed": 47.5,
            "groups": [
                1,
                2
            ],
            "status": 'parked'
        },...
    ]
}
```

As you can see, the vehicles array holds an array of integers, these are the groups that the vehicle belongs to, these 
are gathered from the `vehicle_groups.json`.

In the `vehicle_stats` object we expect the keys to be strings, these are gathered from the vehicles and with a count of 
how many vehicles are of this status, there is also a total key with the total of all the vehicles, an example of this
would be:

```
{
    "vehicle_stats": {
        "status_1": 5,
        "status_2": 15,
        "status_3": 10,
        "total": 30
    }
}
```

For extra points, do a version or explain how you would do it without using a for/foreach.
